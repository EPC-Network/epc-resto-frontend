### Frontend Dev Live Coding Template (React + Typescript)

This is a simple React + Typescript template of an order management system for Sukiya, a Japanese restaurant made just
for introverts.

Feel free to explore the structure, but the actual task and API documentation will be provided during the _live coding
interview_.
